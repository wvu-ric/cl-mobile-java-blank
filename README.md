Java Blank

Object is the grandfather to just about every object we will encounter while building our Android apps. We'll also be making plenty of our objects on top of Object. The proper term for this is creating "subclasses" of Object.

Create a new subclass of Object called Blank.  Then, create a new instance of your Blank object with the variable name myBlankObject in the provided client.
